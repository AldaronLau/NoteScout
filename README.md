# NoteScout
Note streaming social media platform (or something like that).

## User Manual
To build NoteScout from source, you must install Dart and Flutter by following
the OS-specific instructions at https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install.

When you're all set, make sure everything works fine with Flutter Doctor; Once
you're at that point, either install an Emulator in Android Studio or plug in
your phone.  NoteScout works on both Android and iOS.

After that, launching the app is as simple as `flutter run`.  It might take a
while, but it will eventually open on your phone (make sure that you have
developer settings turned on first, though - or it won't work).

For the User Manual on setting up the backend server code, check out the
[README in the backend directory](backend/README.md).
